      <p>Batman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, first appeared in Batman #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity.
        Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce.
        The character " lends a homely touch to Batman's environs and is ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick</p>
